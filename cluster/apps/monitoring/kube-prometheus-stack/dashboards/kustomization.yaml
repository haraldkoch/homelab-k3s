# When grafana is enabled, kube-prometheus-stack provisions a collection of
# grafana dashboards useful for Kubernetes monitoring.
#
# This kustomization pulls the source dashboards (from kube-prometheus),
# labels them so our independent instance of grafana will pick them up, and
# loads them into k8s.
