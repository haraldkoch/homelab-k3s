[K3S](https://k3s.io/) test "cluster" on a single [Arch Linux](https://www.archlinux.org/) host on my homelab server.

## Off-cluster support

- [harbor](https://goharbor.io/): Docker registry and local cache - coupled with [harbor-container-webhook](https://github.com/indeedeng-alpha/harbor-container-webhook) to tell Kubernetes to use the cache.
- [blocky](https://github.com/0xERR0R/blocky): lightweight ad-blocking DNS resolver - this is replacing Pi-Hole.
- [coredns](https://coredns.io/): host the static portion of my home network's DNS.

## Cluster components

- [SOPS](https://toolkit.fluxcd.io/guides/mozilla-sops/): Encrypts secrets which is safe to store - even to a public repository.
- [calico](https://www.tigera.io/project-calico/): container networking with policy enforcement.
- [metallb](https://metallb.universe.tf/): Kubernetes Load Balancer that runs on Kubernetes.
- [external-dns](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/external-dns): monitors service and ingress resources, and automatically generates DNS updates for them. This lets me maintain DNS mappings and LetsEncrypt certificates without a cloudflare account or domain.
- [cert-manager](https://cert-manager.io/docs/): Configured to create TLS certs for all ingress services automatically using LetsEncrypt.
- [traefik ingress](https://doc.traefik.io/traefik/providers/kubernetes-ingress/): Ingress controller based on Traefik (but not Rancher's default)
- [nfs-subdir-external-provisioner](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/nfs-subdir-external-provisioner): creates Persistent Volumes on a pre-existing NFS mount.
- [democratic-csi](https://github.com/democratic-csi/democratic-csi): creates Persistent Volumes on a ZFS server as separate datasets, and exports them via NFS to the Kubernetes cluter.
- [system-upgrade-controller](https://github.com/rancher/system-upgrade-controller): Automatically upgrade the K3S kubernetes instance.
- [prometheus](https://github.com/prometheus-community/helm-charts/tree/main/charts/kube-prometheus-stack): metrics, monitoring, and alerting
- [kasten-io](https://www.kasten.io/product/): backups!
- And more!

## Home Infrastructure

- [hajimari](https://github.com/toboshii/hajimari): a pretty start page with Kubernetes autodiscovery.
- [openweathermap-exporter](https://github.com/blackrez/openweathermap_exporter): a Prometheus exporter for Openweather.
- [weather-exporter](https://github.com/celliott/weather_exporter): the much older weather exporter using the DarkSky API.

## Applications

- [bookstack](https://www.bookstackapp.com/): full featured documentation platform.
- [home-assistant](https://www.home-assistant.io/): Home Automation Hub.
- [tautulli](https://github.com/Tautulli/Tautulli): Plex usage monitoring application.

Yes, this is a lot of infrastructure and heavy lifting - the point is to experiment with Kubernetes and GitOps in a safe space. But this is increasingly becoming primary infrastructure for my home LAN...

I have two longer-term goals:

1. migrate many of the apps that I currently run on Linode to a K8S cluster at Linode or Digital Ocean.
2. Build a small Raspberry Pi cluster at home to run all of this infrastructure, including pi-hole, homeassistant, and maybe even plex!

## Repository structure

The Git repository contains the following directories under `cluster` and are ordered below by how Flux will apply them.

- **base** directory is the entrypoint to Flux
- **crds** directory contains custom resource definitions (CRDs) that need to exist globally in your cluster before anything else exists
- **core** directory (depends on **crds**) are important infrastructure applications (grouped by namespace) that should never be pruned by Flux
- **apps** directory (depends on **core**) is where your common applications (grouped by namespace) could be placed, Flux will prune resources here if they are not tracked by Git anymore

```
./cluster
├── ./apps
├── ./base
├── ./core
└── ./crds
```

## Automation

- Rancher [System Upgrade Controller](https://github.com/rancher/system-upgrade-controller) to apply updates to k3s
- [Renovate](https://github.com/renovatebot/renovate) with the help of the [k8s-at-home/renovate-helm-releases](https://github.com/k8s-at-home/renovate-helm-releases) Github action keeps my application charts and container images up-to-date
- [Github Actions](https://docs.github.com/en/actions) automatically runs renovate
